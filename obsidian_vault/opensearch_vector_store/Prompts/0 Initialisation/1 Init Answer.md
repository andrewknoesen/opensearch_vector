- "How do I set up hybrid search combining keyword and vector search in OpenSearch"
    

## Data Ingestion

- "Show me how to use the Bulk API to ingest vector data into OpenSearch"
    
- "What's the optimal batch size when importing vector embeddings to OpenSearch"
    
- "How can I verify my vectors were properly indexed in OpenSearch"
    
- "Provide code examples for ingesting vector data using Python/Java/etc."
    

## Query Construction and Search

- "How do I construct an effective vector search query in OpenSearch"
    
- "Show me examples of k-NN queries with different parameters in OpenSearch"
    
- "How do I implement hybrid search combining vector similarity with metadata filtering"
    
- "What are the best practices for tuning search relevance in vector queries"
    

## Integration with LLMs

- "How do I integrate OpenSearch vector search with an LLM for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)"
    
- "Provide code for a complete pipeline that uses OpenSearch for retrieval and an LLM for generation"
    
- "How should I format the context from OpenSearch vector search results for my LLM prompt"
    
- "What's the optimal number of search results to include in my LLM context window"
    

## Performance Optimization

- "How do I optimize my OpenSearch vector search for speed and accuracy"
    
- "What index settings should I adjust to improve vector search performance"
    
- "How do I scale my OpenSearch vector database as my data grows"
    
- "What monitoring metrics should I track for my vector search implementation"
    

## Specific Implementation Examples

- "Walk me through building a semantic search application using OpenSearch as the vector store"
    
- "How do I implement a recommendation system using OpenSearch vector search"
    
- "Show me how to build a question-answering system with OpenSearch and an LLM"
    

By using these prompts, you'll get comprehensive guidance covering the entire process of implementing OpenSearch as a vector store, from initial setup through to advanced search functionality and LLM integration[1](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/open-search/integrate-opensearch-with-an-llm-for-intelligent-operation-and-maintenance)[2](https://bigdataboutique.com/blog/recipes-to-vectors-using-opensearch-as-vector-database-aba607)[3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/serverless-vector-search.html)[4](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/vector_stores/OpensearchDemo/)[5](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/build-conversational-search-based-on-opensearch-vector-search-edition-integrated-with-a-large-language-model_600119).
